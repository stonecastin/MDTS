Queers and Allies is a club at Middlebury centered around LGBTQ discussions, events, and parties. As said on their site:

"Q&A seeks to create a supportive social community, as well as raise awareness and create dialogue on LGBTQ issues and the multiple identities that intersect with them (e.g., race, religion, (dis)ability, class, and nation).
We hold topic-driven discussion meetings, throw parties, host kickbacks, bring LGBTQ speakers and performers to campus, organize and/or advertise other queer-related events, and more.
Our membership is a diverse community of people who hold a variety of opinions â€” all are welcome!""
