title: MDTS Information
---

The Middlebury Directory for Trans Students will be a three fold resource, first, a mentorship program for incoming trans and questioning students, second, a directory of group chats sorted by topic (activism, medical transition, making friends, etc.), and third, a repository of experiences of trans students knowledge and experience on campus.

MDTS will be used to connect students, compile information for campus transitions, and as a repository of experience and journalistic projects centering around trans culture at Midd.


FAQ

I want to be a mentor, how will you protect my information?

Mentors will be semi-randomly assigned, with those having specific experience (i.e., transitioning medically, changing names on campus, etc.) requested by the mentee at the top of the list.
Then I will give both parties each other’s phone number and name.
I will hold all personal phone numbers in confidence, only giving them out once the prospective mentee has given me their name and phone number, and  only giving them out to prospective mentees.

Any incidences of harassment will be reported to the administration by me and the mentor jointly.
I will help you with the reporting process should it come to that.


I don’t want to be a mentor, but I (want to/don’t want to) stay up to date on MDTS.

Please respond to this email with your preference. A lack of response will be assumed to mean you do not wish to be contacted further.



Is MDTS a student organization?

No. MDTS is not affiliated with the administration, and will remain unaffiliated.
I am creating the directory as a neutral interface for any trans or questioning students, and remaining unaffiliated means that MDTS does not need to follow school policy, and will never have to answer to the administration.
That being said, harassment or abuse carried out through MDTS will not be tolerated.


(X trans midd student) would like this information, can I forward it to them / put them in contact with you?

Please! I don’t know every trans person on campus, and I would like word of this to spread as far as possible.


I have (X unaddressed concern, interest, or comment)

I welcome any feedback on the directory. Please email me at estone@middlebury.edu or stonecastin@gmail.com with your thoughts.
