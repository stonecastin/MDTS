title: MDTS Information

The Middlebury Directory for Trans Students will be a three fold resource, first, a mentorship program for incoming trans and questioning students, second, a directory of group chats sorted by topic (activism, medical transition, making friends, etc.), and third, a repository of experiences of trans students knowledge and experience on campus.

MDTS will be used to connect students, compile information for campus transitions, and as a repository of experience and journalistic projects centering around trans culture at Midd.


FAQ

Is MDTS a club at Middlebury?

No. MDTS is not affiliated with the administration, and will remain unaffiliated.
I am creating the directory as a neutral interface for any trans or questioning students, and remaining unaffiliated means that MDTS does not need to follow school policy, and will never have to answer to the administration.
That being said, harassment or abuse carried out through MDTS will not be tolerated.

I want to be on the email list

[Email me](https://forms.gle/qLEyrVUhX9rszC376) and I will put you on the email list. I send minimal emails.

I have x experience I want to contribute

That's great!
The directory has several ongoing calls for content, including the transphobic incidents log, HRT / legal name change experience by state, and the repository for Trans joy.
Please check the page in question for submission guidelines.

If your submission is unrelated to these ongoing projects please send it to me anyway.
The directory is a composite of all Trans experiences at Midd and any suggestions, corrections, or critique is appreciated.

[Email me](https://forms.gle/qLEyrVUhX9rszC376) or, if you have experience using GitHub, this page has a [repositoty](https://github.com/stonecastin/MDTS).
I will review any submissions and let you know when they are applied to the site.

I want to be a mentor / mentee

[Email me](etone@middlebury.edu). Applications for both mentors and mentees are currently open.

I want to be a mentor / mentee, how will you protect my information?

Mentors will be semi-randomly assigned, with those having specific experience (i.e., transitioning medically, changing names on campus, etc.) requested by the mentee at the top of the list.
Then I will give both parties each otherâ€™s phone number and name.
I will hold all personal phone numbers in confidence, only giving them out once the prospective mentee has given me their name and phone number, and  only giving them out to prospective mentees.

Any incidences of harassment will be reported to the administration by me and the mentor / mentee jointly.
I will help you with the reporting process should it come to that.

I have a project I would like to add to the Directory

Please [Email me](https://forms.gle/qLEyrVUhX9rszC376) with a description of your project and how best to link it.
Projects of all kinds (arts, performance, journalism, etc.) are accepted and appreciated.
