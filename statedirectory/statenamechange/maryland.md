title: Maryland Name Change
---

*Approximate date: summer 2021

total cost: $165 filing fee and $85 publishing fee, $250 total

court process: I filled out three forms, CC-DR-075, CC-DR-061, and CC-DR-060.
I took those forms to the circut court for my county, and had to navigate to the family department offices.
I expected finding it to be more of an issue but there are maps available online.
I messed up filling out the forms so the clerk gave me some new ones to fill out while I was there.
I brought my drivers liscense as a form of ID and after checking that and taking my forms I was all set.
The filing fee was processed first, and the publishing fee would only be processed when the petition was published a few weeks later.
All in all I spent only half an hour in the court building itself, but I made sure to go in during normal working hours when it would be less crowded.

What I wish I knew: Asking a lot of questions doesn't bother anybody, and often makes their job easier if they have the right information first rather than having to follow up about it.
Calling is a good way of getting the information you need, it can be nerve wracking but it wound up being really helpful.
If I could do it again I would already have the next steps set up; the social security admnistration wants to be updated within 30 days of the name change going through (that's 30 days after the court approves it, which is 15 days after the notice is published.)
It's also a good idea to keep track of which agencies only accept documents in person.
"Filing" means handing documents to the clerk at the courthouse.
